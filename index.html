            <h1><i>Fact about Bird</i></h1>
            <h2><i><U>Kiwis</U></i></h2>
            <p>Native to New Zealand, kiwis are a bizarre, land-bound bird.<br> Scientists so mystified by the kiwi's strange properties<br>which include feathers that feel like hair, heavy bones filled with marrow,<br>and nostrils on the tip of their nose<br> (rather than on the base of their beak like most birds)‚Äîhave sometimes called them "honorary mammals".</p>

            <h2><i>Bird!</i></h2>
            <P>Step 1:<br> Start with a square piece of origami paper.<br> If you only have regular 8.5x11 paper, follow these instructions to make a square sheet.<br> You can also use these colorful Printable Origami Paper.</P>
            <P>Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner. You should have an upside down triangle.</P>
            <P>Step 3: Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down. Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings.</P>
            <P>Step 4: Turn the paper over.</P>
            <P>Step 5: Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up like this.</P>
            <P>	Step 6: Fold the figure in half by folding the left side over to the right.</P>
            <P>	Step 7: Now fold that same flap back<br> like this to make one of the wings.</P>
            <P>Step 8: Fold the other wing back also.</P>
            <P>Step 9: Push the center of the head in and flatten.<br> This is called an inside reverse fold.</P>
            <P>	Step 10: And tada! You have yourself a bird.<br> Now set it free! Just kidding. Don't throw it in the air. It will just fall down and you'll be disappointed.</P>

            <h1><i>Fact about Butterflys</i></h1>
            <p>Butterflies use their feet to taste.<br>If everything up until this point was already a part of your existing butterfly knowledge, this fact may come as a curveball.<br>However, if you think about it from the butterfly‚Äôs point of view, it isn‚Äôt that unusual.<br>A butterfly‚Äôs daily activities consist of eating and mating,<br> of which require landing ‚Äì even if it is only briefly. When food is the priority,<br>those taste receptors help the butterfly locate the right plants and the key nutrients it needs for survival.<br>Although many people wonder what it means when a butterfly lands on them, the truth is that it‚Äôs probably just hungry.</p>

            <P>Step 4: Fold in all four corners so their edges meet at the center horizontal crease.</P>
            <P>Step 5: Fold down the top half.</P>
            <P>Step 6: Fold the center of the bottom half to the top half.<br>Crease about one inch (2.5 cm) of the center only with your fingernail.<br>Do not crease all the way.<br> your finger and there should be a crease in the center only.</P>
            <P>	Step 7: Turn the paper over.<br>Go to Next page to continue learning how to make an origami butterfly that flaps.</P>
            <P>Step 8: Place a finger on top of the center of the paper and with your other hand, wrap the paper snugly around your finger.</P>
            <P>Step 9: Remove your finger and you should have a loop like this.</P>
            <P>Step 10: Use a fingernail and poke in the center of the bottom of the loop.</P>
            <P>Step 11: With your forefinger and thumb, grab both ends of the loop holes and pinch them together.<br>Pinch and release to make the butterfly flap!</P>
            <P>Step 12: Draw and design the butterfly wings and email your origami butterfly to me so I can show it off to everybody!</P>
